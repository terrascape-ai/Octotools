The first cousin put up his interest in the joint tenancy as security for a $20,000 loan and signed a judgment note. It was later entered as a judgment against the first cousin's interest in the real estate. The first cousin died a year later. The second cousin decided to sell the property, but the mortgagee filed an action to prevent the sale and to enforce his interest in the property. The second cousin defended on the basis that any lien on the first cousin's interest in the property was extinguished on the first cousin's death. Will the court enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the sale of the property by the surviving second cousin?\nA. Yes, because the second cousin's assent to the judgment lien was presumed by law and that assent destroyed the joint tenancy.\nB. Yes, because the mortgagee has the right to enforce his interest in the property to recover the loan.\nC. No, because a joint tenant cannot legally file a judgment note on just that joint tenant's interest because it would be an unconstitutional interference with the other's property rights.\nD. No, because when the first cousin died the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, as per the joint tenancy which was still fully intact.\nE. Yes, because a mortgage or judgment lien against one joint tenant destroys the tenancy and destroys the right of survivorship.\nF. No, because the first cousin's debt did not affect the second cousin's rights to the property.\nG. Yes, because the mortgagee has a valid claim to the property due to the first cousin's unpaid loan.\nH. Yes, because the first cousin's debt was not settled before his death, hence the property cannot be sold until the debt is settled.\nI.

How?\nA. The production possibility frontier refers to an outer limit on the finishedconsumer good that a society can produce given its resources and the state of technical knowledge, while the production function describes how various inputs should be employed in order to produce a given amount of output.\nB. The production function is a graph showing the possible combinations of goods that can be produced, while the production possibility frontier is a mathematical equation describing how inputs are transformed into outputs.\nC. The production function focuses on the cost of inputs and the pricing of outputs, whereas the production possibility frontier is about the trade-offs between different goods that society can produce.\nD. The production possibility frontier is a measure of a firm's efficiency, while the production function represents the ethical considerations in production choices.\nE. The production possibility frontier shows the maximum output that can be achieved with a given set of inputs, without considering the technology used, while the production function is specific to the technology applied in the production process.\nF. The production possibility frontier is a detailed financial plan for a company's production, while the production function is a broader economic model for industry-wide production.\nG. The production function and production possibility frontier are the same concept used in different fields of economics.\nH. The production possibility frontier is solely concerned with the quantity of goods produced, ignoring the quality, while the production function takes into account both the quantity and quality of goods produced.\nI. The production possibility frontier illustrates the various combinations of two goods that can be produced, assuming constant returns to scale, while the production function assumes increasing, decreasing, or constant returns to scale based on the level of input.",

A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rh\u00e9tel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the cur\u00e9, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.\n\u2014Report of the Estates of Normandy, 1651\nWhich of the following would be most responsible for ending the problems of hunger mentioned above?\nA. The development of a welfare system to support those in need\nB. The increase in population during the seventeenth century leading to more workers in the field\nC. The discovery of new trade routes that brought in more food\nD. The elimination of fallow fields through the agricultural revolution during the seventeenth century\nE. The introduction of new crops from the New World during the Columbian Exchange\nF. The implementation of a universal basic income\nG. The elimination of the Black Plague in Europe during the seventeenth century\nH. The creation of a strong putting-out system that allowed people to be paid for their work\nI. A declining population during the seventeenth century that led to better food yields and less hunger as Europe urbanized",

There were no warning signs keeping pedestrians out or warning of unloading trucks. A pedestrian walked through the general vicinity but he avoided the unloading area. One of the workers pulled the wrong lever and a load of commercial refrigerators crashed into the street, causing a rumbling tremor in the road. The tremor caused a heavy box to fall off of a parked truck that was about 30 yards away from the loading dock. It fell on the pedestrian, causing serious injury. The pedestrian sued the appliance store for negligence, and the store defended on the basis that it could not foresee such an accident and that the tremor and the box that fell were superseding acts. Will the pedestrian likely survive the store's motion to dismiss pedestrian's lawsuit for damages.\nA. No, the accident was caused by a worker's mistake, not a lack of warning signs or barriers.\nB. No, because the plaintiff in effect became a trespasser when he walked into a dangerous loading/unloading area.\nC.

During the search, a police officer went to a home and rang the doorbell. When a teenage male opened the door, the police officer told him that a convict had escaped and asked if he had seen anyone suspicious in the neighborhood. The teenager said he hadn't but then asked the police officer to come inside to ensure the house was safe. The police officer entered the home and proceeded to look around. When he went into the kitchen, the police officer noticed a bag containing white powder on the counter. Suspecting that the bag contained narcotics, the police officer questioned the teenager as to its contents. The teenager said he didn't live in the house and had never seen it before. The police officer confiscated the bag and took the teenager to the station house for questioning, at which time it was determined that the teenager had escaped from a psychiatric hospital and had broken into the home earlier in the day. Furthermore, the results of a police lab test found that the bag contained heroin. As a result, the police issued an arrest warrant for the owner of the home.
