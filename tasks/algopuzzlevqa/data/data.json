The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise.

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise.

To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'R2' starting from the state shown in the image.

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nThe toy shown in the figure has eight coloured disks on its front, and three holes on its top \u2013 left, right, and center \u2013 through which a ball bearing could be dropped. Each disk would display either a yellow or blue face. When a ball passes through a disc it tips the disk mechanism which flips the face color. The tipping of the disc mechanism determines whether the ball would be deflected to the left or to the right. The vertical walls between the discs would then determine the path of motion of the ball. A dropped ball always passes through exactly one disc in each of the top and the bottom row. Depending on the configuration of the top three discs it may or may not pass through the middle row. Finally, when the ball falls to the bottom it would exit either to a hole on the left or the right of the device. Two balls are dropped in sequence through the following holes: right, center. Consider the toy configuration after all the balls have been dropped and they have exited from the bottom. How many yellow faces can be seen in total in all the rows now?\nA. 7\nB. 0\nC. 4\nD. 6",
