Task: Determine the optimal next step to address the given query based on the provided analysis, available tools, and previous steps taken.

Context:
Query: {question}
Image: {image}
Query Analysis: {query_analysis}

Available Tools:
{self.available_tools}

Tool Metadata:
{self.toolbox_metadata}

Previous Steps and Their Results:
{memory.get_actions()}

Current Step: {step_count} in {max_step_count} steps
Remaining Steps: {max_step_count - step_count}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the context thoroughly, including the query, its analysis, any image, available tools and their metadata, and previous steps taken.

2. Determine the most appropriate next step by considering:
   - Key objectives from the query analysis
   - Capabilities of available tools
   - Logical progression of problem-solving
   - Outcomes from previous steps
   - Current step count and remaining steps

3. Select ONE tool best suited for the next step, keeping in mind the limited number of remaining steps.

4. Formulate a specific, achievable sub-goal for the selected tool that maximizes progress towards answering the query.

Output Format:
<justification>: detailed explanation of why the selected tool is the best choice for the next step, considering the context and previous outcomes.
<context>: MUST include ALL necessary information for the tool to function, structured as follows:
    * Relevant data from previous steps
    * File names or paths created or used in previous steps (list EACH ONE individually)
    * Variable names and their values from previous steps' results
    * Any other context-specific information required by the tool
<sub_goal>: a specific, achievable objective for the tool, based on its metadata and previous outcomes. It MUST contain any involved data, file names, and variables from Previous Steps and Their Results that the tool can act upon.
<tool_name>: MUST be the exact name of a tool from the available tools list.

Rules:
- Select only ONE tool for this step.
- The sub-goal MUST directly address the query and be achievable by the selected tool.
- The Context section MUST include ALL necessary information for the tool to function, including ALL relevant file paths, data, and variables from previous steps.
- The tool name MUST exactly match one from the available tools list: {self.available_tools}.
- Avoid redundancy by considering previous steps and building on prior results.

Example (do not copy, use only as reference):
<justification>: [Your detailed explanation here]
<context>: Image path: "example/image.jpg", Previous detection results: [list of objects]
<sub_goal>: Detect and count the number of specific objects in the image "example/image.jpg"

Detailed Instructions:
1. Carefully analyze the query, initial analysis, and image (if provided):
   - Identify the main objectives of the query.
   - Note any specific requirements or constraints mentioned.
   - If an image is provided, consider its relevance and what information it contributes.

2. Review the available tools and their metadata:
   - Understand the capabilities and limitations and best practices of each tool.
   - Consider how each tool might be applicable to the query.

3. Examine the memory content in detail:
   - Review each tool used and its execution results.
   - Assess how well each tool's output contributes to answering the query.

4. Critical Evaluation (address each point explicitly):
   a) Completeness: Does the memory fully address all aspects of the query?
      - Identify any parts of the query that remain unanswered.
      - Consider if all relevant information has been extracted from the image (if applicable).

   b) Unused Tools: Are there any unused tools that could provide additional relevant information?
      - Specify which unused tools might be helpful and why.

   c) Inconsistencies: Are there any contradictions or conflicts in the information provided?
      - If yes, explain the inconsistencies and suggest how they might be resolved.

   d) Verification Needs: Is there any information that requires further verification due to tool limitations?
      - Identify specific pieces of information that need verification and explain why.

   e) Ambiguities: Are there any unclear or ambiguous results that could be clarified by using another tool?
      - Point out specific ambiguities and suggest which tools could help clarify them.

5. Final Determination:
   Based on your thorough analysis, decide if the memory is complete and accurate enough to generate the final output, or if additional tool usage is necessary.

Response Format:
<analysis>: Provide a detailed analysis of why the memory is sufficient. Reference specific information from the memory and explain its relevance to each aspect of the task. Address how each main point of the query has been satisfied.
<stop_signal>: Whether to stop the problem solving process and proceed to generating the final output.
    * "True": if the memory is sufficient for addressing the query to proceed and no additional available tools need to be used. If ONLY manual verification without tools is needed, choose "True".
    * "False": if the memory is insufficient and needs more information from additional tool usage.
