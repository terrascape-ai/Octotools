However, despite significant progress, current scientific reasoning models still struggle with generalization across domains and often fall short of multimodal perception. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrate text, images, and other modalities, present an exciting opportunity to overcome these limitations and enhance scientific reasoning. Therefore, this position paper argues that MLLMs can significantly advance scientific reasoning across disciplines such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. First, we propose a four-stage research roadmap of scientific reasoning capabilities, and highlight the current state of MLLM applications in scientific reasoning, noting their ability to integrate and reason over diverse data types. Second, we summarize the key challenges that remain obstacles to achieving MLLM's full potential. To address these challenges, we propose actionable insights and suggestions for the future. Overall, our work offers a novel perspective on MLLM integration with scientific reasoning, providing the LLM community with a valuable vision for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, yet their performance is highly dependent on the prompting strategy and model scale. While reinforcement learning and fine-tuning have been deployed to boost reasoning, these approaches incur substantial computational and data overhead. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Graph of Thoughts (AGoT), a dynamic, graph-based inference framework that enhances LLM reasoning solely at test time. Rather than relying on fixed-step methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts (ToT), AGoT recursively decomposes complex queries into structured subproblems, forming an dynamic directed acyclic graph (DAG) of interdependent reasoning steps. By selectively expanding only those subproblems that require further analysis, AGoT unifies the strengths of chain, tree, and graph paradigms into a cohesive framework that allocates computation where it is most needed. We validate our approach on diverse benchmarks spanning multi-hop retrieval, scientific reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving, achieving up to 46.2% improvement on scientific reasoning tasks (GPQA) - comparable to gains achieved through computationally intensive reinforcement learning approaches and outperforming state-of-the-art iterative approaches. These results suggest that dynamic decomposition and structured recursion offer a scalable, cost-effective alternative to post-training modifications, paving the way for more robust, general-purpose reasoning in LLMs.",

Importantly, mathematical reasoning allows each step to be derived from a small set of premises, which are a subset of the preceding steps in the reasoning chain. In this paper, we present a framework that identifies the premises for each step, to improve the evaluation of reasoning.

The accuracy of error identification improves by 6% to 16% absolute when step-by-step verification is carried out in PARC under the premises.
