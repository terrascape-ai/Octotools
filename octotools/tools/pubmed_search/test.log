[{'title': 'Safety of health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond: piloting WHO framework in Iran.', 'abstract': "BACKGROUND: Health Workers Safety (HWS) is a global health priority and essential at all times, in stable situations, in emergencies, in disease epidemics or pandemics. This study aimed to assess HWS during the COVID-19 Pandemic.\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2022 in east Azerbaijan province, Iran. HWS was assessed based on 22 indicators suggested by WHO EMRO. We selected 15 PHC facilities and six wards from two hospitals randomly. Data collected (qualitative and quantitative) using national digital health records, staff records, and indicator-specific tools. In addition to measuring the indicator's value, the indicators' feasibility was also assessed. Descriptive and inferential statistics with SPSS-16 were used for data analysis.\nRESULTS: Totally, 325 Health Workers (HWs) (218 from PHC facilities and 107 from hospitals) participated in the study. Most of the participants in PHC facilities and hospitals were Community Health Workers (CHWs) (Moragheb Salamat) (45.4%) and nurses (37.38%), respectively. Most of HWs had completed the full vaccination schedule for Hepatitis B and COVID-19. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) safety protocols were adhered by most of HWs within a healthcare facility. None of managers had attended nationally certified training for mental health support for health and care workers. Less than 20% of HWs participated in the work burnout prevention courses and most of HWs complained about work overload, or burnout. The job satisfaction level of hospital HWs (60.20%) was significantly higher than that of HWs from PHC facilities (57.18%) (P\u2009<\u20090.001).\nCONCLUSION: Even though the mental health of HWs was not as expected, the indicators related to physical health and occupational health were at a suitable level. Also, there is not a system in PHC to audit the application of safety measures to mitigate the risk of contracting COVID-19. We recommend creating a specific system (precise and detailed) for HWs' safety and applying safety measures in the PHC routine programs.", 'keywords': ['Assessment', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Health worker', 'Iran', 'Safety'], 'url': 'https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39920792'}, {'title': 'Experiences of working as a clinical nurse while pregnant during the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic: a qualitative study.', 'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: Working as a pregnant clinical nurse might experience a range of challenges, such as significant anatomical and physiological changes as well as emotional and cognitive changes. That might be particularly obvious under the historical background of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, a dearth of studies has explored the experiences of working as a pregnant nurse during this special period. This study aimed to explore the experiences of working as a clinical nurse while pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMETHODS: A descriptive qualitative design was selected. Purposive sampling, combined with maximum variation strategy and snowball sampling, were utilized to identify and select participants from tertiary-teaching hospitals, specialized hospitals, and community hospitals in Zhejiang Province, southeastern China. Online semi-structured individual interviews were used to collect data, and conventional content analysis was used to analyze the data.\nRESULTS: Eleven Chinese nurses with a mean age of 31.8 years, ranging from 26 to 40 years, participated in this study. Four themes and twelve subthemes emerged: (1) still adhering to work as a clinical nurse despite being pregnant during the pandemic; (2) working during pregnancy under pandemic is still an ordinary nurse; (3) still staying in the special life phase as a pregnant mother; and (4) growth and gains as pregnant mother.\nCONCLUSION: The pregnant clinical nurses suffered from various changes and difficulties during the pandemic. Managers, occupational health and other health system leaders, and policymakers should be aware of the importance of establishing a work environment that guarantees safe continued pregnancy. Future studies should focus on the establishment of specific guidelines and manuals regarding how pregnant nurses worked, as well as the development of self-protection interventions during pregnancy. Moreover, research on moral stigma and bullying in nursing during pregnancy deserves further exploration.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.', 'keywords': ['COVID-19 pandemic', 'Experiences', 'Nurse', 'Pregnant', 'Qualitative research'], 'url': 'https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39901239'}, {'title': "Development and psychometric validation of the frontline health workers' occupational risk and characteristics in emergencies index (FORCE-index) - The covid Hospital cohort study.", 'abstract': "OBJECTIVES: A lack of tools for the systematic identification of frontline health workers' changing occupational risks, characteristics, and needs, poses a major barrier to supporting vital personnel to stay in practice through health emergencies and beyond. The current study reports on the development and psychometric evaluation of the Frontline health workers' Occupational Risk and Characteristics in Emergencies index (FORCE-index).\nSTUDY DESIGN: The Covid hospital study is a large, multisite, four-wave, open cohort study of frontline health workers responding to the first four waves of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2022).\nMETHODS: 2496 frontline health workers responded to questionnaires assessing various aspects of their work environment. Using exploratory factor analysis, we estimated the latent structure of the FORCE-index at the first and second waves. This structure was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis at the third and fourth waves. The internal consistency of the instrument's subscales (e.g., factors) was evaluated using omega reliability, Cronbach's alpha coefficient, and mean inter-item correlation.\nRESULTS: A nine-factor solution provided best fit to the data. These factors mapped onto the following aspects of the work environment; competency, stress management, familiarity, workload manageability, work performance, infection safety, personal protective equipment, social safety, and social support. Internal consistency for the full FORCE-index and the nine factors was satisfactory.\nCONCLUSIONS: The initial psychometric validation indicates that the FORCE-index is a valid measure which can be used by health authorities, services, and institutions to adequately and systematically assess central aspects of frontline health workers' work environment that are commonly challenged in health emergencies.", 'keywords': ['Covid-19', 'Frontline', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care worker', 'Health emergency', 'Health response', 'Hospital', 'Index', 'Infectious outbreak', 'Job characteristics', 'Occupational Health', 'Occupational diseases', 'Occupational exposure', 'Occupational stress', 'Preparedness', 'Preparedness planning', 'Psychometric', 'Scale', 'Stress', 'Work environment'], 'url': 'https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39896339'}, {'title': "A descriptive analysis of nurses' self-reported mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: An international study.", 'abstract': "AIM: To describe the self-reported mental health of nurses from 35 countries who worked during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBACKGROUND: There is little occupationally specific data about nurses' mental health worldwide.

Data reflect a convenience sample of\xa09,387 participants who completed the opt-in survey between July 31, 2022, and October 31, 2023. Descriptive statistics were run to analyze the following variables associated with mental health: Self-reports of mental health symptoms, burnout, personal losses during the pandemic, access to mental health services, and self-care practices used to cope with pandemic-related stressors. Reporting of this study was steered by the STROBE guideline for quantitative studies.\nRESULTS: Anxiety or depression occurred at rates ranging from 23%-61%, with country-specific trends in reporting observed. Approximately 18% of the sample reported experiencing some symptoms of burnout. The majority of nurses' employers did not provide mental health support in the workplace. Most reported more frequently engaging with self-care practices compared with before the pandemic. Notably, 20% of nurses suffered the loss of a family member, 35% lost a friend, and 34% a coworker due to COVID-19.

This study develops an optimized HFE evaluation model based on fundamental HFE principles. Examining COVID-19's significant impact on construction enterprise OHS, this research employs an empirical investigation of 259 cases, utilizing a model that integrates NetLogo's System Dynamics (SD) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to analyze the interactions between human factors and other variables. The findings reveal four key factors influencing human factors: management, material, environmental, and methodological. These factors demonstrate a quadratic parabolic relationship, with peak influence occurring at step 36 of the research period. Twelve of the 20 survey factors exhibit a linear regression relationship with human factors' four sub-factors, with pre-job training (Q<sub>9</sub>) demonstrating multiple influential interactions. The strongest correlation is between pre-job training (Q<sub>9</sub>) and living materials (Q<sub>14</sub>), with a weight coefficient of .325.

Therefore, it was important to adapt workplace countermeasures punctually and flexibly based on scientific evidence and according to circumstances. However, there has been no assessment of changes in workplace countermeasures. With a view toward preparedness for future pandemics, we surveyed COVID-19 workplace countermeasures that occupational physicians considered as needing to be changed but went unchanged.\nMETHODS: We invited 685 professional occupational physicians certified by Japan Society for Occupational Health to complete an online questionnaire by sending postcards with QR codes. The main questions concerned countermeasures that the participants wanted to change but could not. The survey period was from February 21 to April 28, 2022. The responses were analyzed using the KJ method.\nRESULTS: Of the 168 invitees (24.5%) who responded to the survey, 125 reported countermeasures that needed to be changed (total count: 254). The responses were categorized into basic systems, occupational health services, workplace countermeasures, vaccines, and incidents, with a code count of 7, 8,147, 10, and 82, respectively. The type of countermeasure was 115 for countermeasures to be strengthened (CBS), 110 for measures to be mitigated (CBM), and 29 for neither.\nCONCLUSIONS: Often-mentioned CBS were increased teleworking, strengthened ventilation, smoking cessation, and promotion of vaccines. Often-mentioned CBM were relaxation of protective equipment rules, discontinued environmental disinfection, and shorted isolation and reinstatement. In the early pandemic phases, CBSs were frequently mentioned, whereas CBMs were featured more prominently in the latter phases. The survey revealed countermeasures that occupational physicians thought needed to be changed but were not changed in practice. For future responses to emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, it will be necessary to establish rules compatible with flexible modification of workplace countermeasures in response to changing circumstances.', 'keywords': ['COVID-19', 'Japan', 'Occupational health', 'Occupational physician', 'Workers', 'Workplace', 'Workplace countermeasures'], 'url': 'https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39780108'}, {'title': 'Rapid COVID-19 Testing of Symptomatic Health Care Personnel: A Strategy for Safely Maintaining the Workforce.', 'abstract': 'Determine performance characteristics and safety outcomes of two rapid COVID-19 screening methods to inform immediate return to work (RTW) decisions while (health care personnel) HCP await results of pending confirmatory laboratory test.

This study aimed to investigate the association between job satisfaction, workload, and psychological distress among CAPS professionals during the pandemic.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 53 professionals from seven CAPS. The Workload Impact Scale (IMPACTO-BR) and Job Satisfaction Scale (SATIS-BR), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and a sociodemographic questionnaire were used. Descriptive and analytical statistical analyses were performed. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between job satisfaction, workload, and psychological distress.\nRESULTS: Professionals reported moderate satisfaction (3.67 ± 0.45) and mild workload (1.82 ± 0.63). One-third of the sample showed scores indicative of psychological distress. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that workload (p = 0.0025) and low job satisfaction (p = 0.0495) were significantly associated with psychological distress.\nCONCLUSIONS: Low job satisfaction and high professional workload were predictive variables of psychological distress.
