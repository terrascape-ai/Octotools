For precise descriptions, consider: using it with other tools for context/verification, as an initial step before refinement, or in multi-step processes for ambiguity resolution. Verify critical information with specialized tools or human expertise when necessary.'}}
Generated Caption:
"The image shows four blue buckets, each containing five baseballs. The buckets are arranged in a grid pattern with three on the top row and one on the bottom left. Each bucket has a handle on the side, and the baseballs inside are white with red stitching, typical of standard baseballs. The background is plain white, emphasizing the buckets and their contents."
Done!
